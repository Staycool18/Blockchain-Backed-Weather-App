# Blockchain-backed Weather App

## Introduction
The Blockchain-backed Weather App is a smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain that provides a secure and reliable platform for managing and accessing weather data. This project aims to leverage the decentralized and immutable nature of the Aptos blockchain to create a transparent and tamper-proof weather data storage system.

## Vision
The primary vision of this project is to create a trusted and decentralized weather data platform that can serve as a reliable source of information for various applications and use cases. By storing weather data on the Aptos blockchain, we can ensure the integrity and availability of this data, while also providing a secure and transparent way for authorized entities to update and access the information.

## Key features:

Uses Aptos's event system to emit updates
Stores oracle address to ensure only authorized updates
Includes timestamp tracking for data freshness
Uses String type for location names
Maintains temperature (Celsius) and humidity (percentage) data

## Future Goals
The future goals of the Blockchain-backed Weather App include:

1. **Expanding Data Coverage**: Gradually expand the coverage of weather data to include more locations, both locally and globally, to provide a comprehensive and widely accessible weather data platform.

2. **Integrating with Third-party Applications**: Develop APIs and integration mechanisms to allow third-party applications and services to seamlessly access and utilize the weather data stored on the Aptos blockchain.

3. **Enabling Decentralized Weather Forecasting**: Explore the possibility of incorporating decentralized weather forecasting models into the platform, leveraging the power of the Aptos blockchain and the data it stores.

4. **Incentivizing Data Contribution**: Investigate ways to incentivize authorized entities, such as weather stations and meteorological agencies, to contribute and update weather data on the platform, further enhancing the completeness and reliability of the weather information.

5. **Expanding to Other Weather-related Services**: Explore the potential of expanding the platform to offer additional weather-related services, such as weather alerts, historical data analysis, and climate research support.
